# TRS-80GP DeZog Extension Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Summary
The TRS-80GP remote type was being rejected by the DeZog VS Code extension with the error:
"Remote type 'trs80gp' does not exist. Allowed are zrcp, cspect, zxnext, zsim, mame."

Despite having a complete TRS-80GP implementation in the codebase, the extension was failing during debug session startup due to validation and launcher issues.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. Runtime Validation Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `src/settings/settings.ts` line 1329 had hardcoded allowed types that didn't include 'trs80gp'
**Solution**: Added 'trs80gp' to the `allowedTypes` array

### 2. Mock Server Packaging Issue ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: `.vscodeignore` was excluding mock server files from VSIX package
**Solution**: Added `!src/remotes/trs80/mock-server/` to ensure mock server files are packaged

### 3. Path Resolution Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Mock server launcher only checked `out/src` path, failing in packaged extensions
**Solution**: Enhanced path resolution to check both `out/src` and `src` directories

### 4. Server Startup Detection Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Launcher was looking for partial string "Mock TRS-80GP server listening" but actual message was "Mock TRS-80GP server listening on port {port}"
**Solution**: Changed detection pattern to look for "listening on port" substring

## Files Modified

1. **`src/settings/settings.ts`** - Line 1329: Added 'trs80gp' to allowedTypes array
2. **`.vscodeignore`** - Added exception for mock server files
3. **`src/remotes/trs80/trs80mockserverlauncher.ts`** - Enhanced path resolution and fixed startup detection

## Validation Results

All fixes have been tested and verified:

✅ **Runtime Validation**: 'trs80gp' now accepted as valid remote type  
✅ **Mock Server Startup**: Server starts successfully and launcher detects it correctly  
✅ **VSIX Packaging**: Mock server files properly included in extension package  
✅ **Path Resolution**: Works in both development and packaged extension environments  
✅ **End-to-End Flow**: Complete debug session startup flow now works  

## Final Deliverable

**`dezog-3.6.3-dev-trs80-final.vsix`** - Complete fixed extension ready for use

### Installation
```bash
code --install-extension dezog-3.6.3-dev-trs80-final.vsix --force
```

### Usage
Configure your VS Code launch.json with:
```json
{
    "type": "dezog",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "TRS-80GP Debug",
    "remoteType": "trs80gp",
    "hostname": "localhost",
    "port": 49152,
    // ... other configuration
}
```

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

The TRS-80GP DeZog extension is now fully functional. All original issues have been resolved:
- ❌ "Remote type 'trs80gp' does not exist" → ✅ trs80gp now recognized
- ❌ Mock server launcher failures → ✅ Launcher works correctly  
- ❌ Missing mock server files → ✅ Files properly packaged
- ❌ Debug session startup failures → ✅ Complete flow working

The extension is ready for production use with TRS-80GP debugging configurations.
